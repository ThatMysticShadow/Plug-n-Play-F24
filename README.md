# IGDA NJIT Plug n' Play 2024!
This is the official repository for the IGDA NJIT chapter's 2024 Plug n' Play Jam (Lasting from Wednesday, November 6 to Tuesday, November 19).

The goal of this jam is for members to create their own levels with their own unique mechancis using a project base provided in this GitHub repository.

The project base is made in Godot, so participants in the jam must use the Godot engine to create their custom levels.

The final, finished project will be a compilation of all of the submitted levels into one finished and publishable game.

## Participants
The base code you will be modifying can be found in the `base` branch of this repository. Be sure to clone that branch using the command:
```
git clone -b base --single-branch https://github.com/IGDA-NJIT-eboard/plug-n-play-f24.git
```
Every script file and packed scene in this project is fully documented to make modifying this project as simple as possible

I have also provided you with a few sample branches to demonstrate some of the modifications you can make to the base project.

The base repository also has a template README.md that you must fill out with all relevant information for me to be able to add your level to the final product.

This game will be designed with controller in mind. DO NOT change the provided project's Input Map and I would strongly advise against including mechanics that require a Mouse.
